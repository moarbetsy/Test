The code you provided for **WagerCharts** positions it as a "Bloomberg Terminal for the gambling industry." Because the site explicitly emphasizes **neutrality, institutional research, and 0% affiliation**, your monetization strategy should avoid traditional gambling affiliate links (which would ruin your credibility) and focus on **B2B (Business to Business) data value.**

Here are five ways to monetize this platform:

### 1. Tiered SaaS Subscription (The "Freemium" Model)
Keep the current dashboard free for basic viewing, but gate-advanced features behind a monthly subscription.
*   **Free Tier:** Current 60s interval analysis, limited historical view (last 24 hours).
*   **Pro Tier ($29 - $99/mo):** Access to the full historical archive, CSV data exports, and the ability to compare more than two platforms (e.g., adding Rollbit, Roobet, BC.Game).
*   **Institutional Tier ($250+/mo):** High-frequency data (5-second intervals), "Whale Tracking" alerts, and sentiment analysis correlated with user volume.

### 2. API Licensing (The Data Play)
Financial analysts, hedge funds, and competing casino operators would pay for raw, programmatic access to this data.
*   **Use Case:** A crypto hedge fund might use your API to see if a drop in Stake’s volume correlates with a drop in a specific cryptocurrency's price.
*   **Model:** Charge based on "calls per minute" or a flat monthly fee for a WebSocket stream of live concurrent user counts.

### 3. Quarterly Industry Reports (The Consulting Play)
Since you are collecting independent data, you can package this into "State of the Industry" PDF reports.
*   **Content:** Deep dives into market share shifts, which platforms are growing fastest in specific time zones, and the impact of major marketing events (e.g., "The impact of a Drake stream on Stake's concurrency").
*   **Pricing:** Sell individual reports for $499 or an annual subscription for $1,500.

### 4. B2B Strategic Advertising
Instead of showing ads for casinos (which hurts your neutrality), show ads for **B2B service providers** that target the gambling industry:
*   **KYC/Compliance providers:** Companies like Sumsub or Onfido.
*   **Cybersecurity firms:** Protection against DDoS (huge in gambling).
*   **Payment Processors:** Crypto gateways looking to reach platform owners.
*   **Crypto Wallets:** Targeting the high-net-worth users who frequent analytics sites.

### 5. Custom "Competitor Intelligence" Dashboards
Offer a service where smaller, upcoming casinos can pay you to build a private dashboard that tracks their performance relative to the "Big Two" (Stake and Shuffle).
*   **The Value:** They use your "Independent Data Integrity" to prove to their investors that they are gaining market share.

### UI/UX Recommendations to Support Monetization:
To start charging, you should add these elements to your HTML:

1.  **Auth System:** Add a "Sign In / Register" button in the header.
2.  **Date Picker:** Your current chart is static. Adding a date-range selector is a high-value feature that users will expect to pay for.
3.  **Platform Expansion:** Add "Grayed out" platform names (e.g., Rollbit, Roobet) with a "Locked" icon to show users what they get if they upgrade.
4.  **"Download CSV" Button:** Place a button above the chart that triggers a "Pro Feature" modal.

### A Note on Your "Independence Statement"
The "0% Affiliation" is your **most valuable asset.** In the gambling world, almost every site is "bought" by a casino. By remaining a neutral data provider, you can eventually exit by being acquired by a major financial news outlet or a large gambling regulatory body. 

**Do not add affiliate links; it will turn your "Institutional Tool" into a "Marketing Site" overnight.**
